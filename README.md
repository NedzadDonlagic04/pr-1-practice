A bunch of random practice problems I solved to prepare myself for exams.
Probably expect some errors or issues somewhere that I missed.

The practice problems were gotten through various means, the professor giving
them out, friends giving ideas on the fly, random interest sites, etc you get
the point, I haven't really been following who gave what idea so I can't properly
credit people, that one's my fault.
