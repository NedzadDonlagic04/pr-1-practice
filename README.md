A bunch of random practice problems I solved to prepare myself for exams.
Probably expect some errors or issues somewhere that I missed.

All of these outside the folder "visual-studio" were solved in visual studio code on linux,
which means that some solutions will not work in visual studio due to the various options
it has enabled for safety which make a lot of things into warnings and errors.
